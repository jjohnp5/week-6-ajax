# SMU Coding Bootcamp Week 6 Homework - AJAX and API

### API Used: [Giphy API](https://developers.giphy.com)

The homework lets users add buttons to the site by using the input form on the right side. After adding the buttons with which topic they want to find pictures of, they can click the button at the top of the page to show GIFs related to the topic they are interested in.
The site shows still images of the gifs. Upon clicking the image itself, the GIFs start animating. The image animations can be stopped and played by clicking on them.
